[2026-02-19] /create_environments — tech stack: Go, Fyne, кроссплатформенность (Windows primary) - Создан NotebookLM_Setup.md с инструкциями. nlm login требуется — пользователь должен аутентифицироваться и выполнить шаги вручную
[2026-02-19] Завершение настройки NotebookLM - Создан ноутбук "CryptoView Debug & Docs" (ID: 7fa1e693-e081-4415-832c-69c96d1350bb). Добавлены источники: Go doc, Effective Go, Fyne doc, Fyne Getting Started, Fyne GitHub, PRD, Implementation, UI_UX_doc, CoinGecko API

[2026-02-20 21:38:23] Adjusted coin timestamp alignment: set updatedAt text leading alignment and replaced default VBox with custom vGapLayout (exact 1px gap) so time starts at same left edge as ticker and sits 1px below top row - Success.
