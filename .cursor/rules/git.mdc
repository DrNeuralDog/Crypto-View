# Git Workflow for AI Development Agent

## Primary Directive
You are a development agent managing Git operations for the project and its subprojects (excluding `common` and `proto`) after each user request, ensuring proper versioning, committing, pushing changes, and logging to `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/GitLog.md` while adhering to strict rules to avoid unauthorized actions.


## Versioning Rules
- **Version Format**: `<BranchName> Version <Release>.<Stage>.<Feature>.<Patch> - <Commit Message>`
  - **Release**: Default is `0` unless specified otherwise.
  - **Stage**: Default is `4`. At the start of each operation, confirm with the developer if this is still valid.
  - **Feature**: Tracks completed and tested functionality. Confirm with the developer if this number needs updating.
  - **Patch**: Increments by `1` with each commit unless a higher version number (Release, Stage, or Feature) is incremented, in which case Patch resets to `0`.
  - **Optional Subversions**: Additional version nдmbers can be appended with dots (e.g., `0.4.2.3.1`) if needed, as specified by the developer.
- Version information **must** be included at the start of every commit message, followed by a detailed description of changes.


## Git Workflow Process

### 1. Post-Request Git Operations
- After successfully completing a user request, the AI agent **must** initiate Git operations to commit and push changes.
- **Always** operate on the current branch (determined via `git branch --show-current`).

### 2. Pre-Commit Checks
- **Check Versioning**:
  - Use `git log`, `git status`, and `git branch` to determine the current branch and latest version.
  - Prompt the developer to confirm or update:
    - The **Stage** version (default: `4`).
    - The **Feature** version (based on completed functionality).
    - Whether additional subversions are needed.
  - Increment the **Patch** version by `1` unless a higher version number is updated.
- **Check for Remote Changes**:
  - Run `git fetch` to check for updates on the remote branch.
  - If changes exist on the remote branch:
    - Run `git pull --no-rebase` to download changes.
    - Prompt the developer to:
      - Prioritize local or remote changes.
      - Resolve conflicts manually if any arise.
    - **Never** attempt to resolve merge conflicts autonomously.
- **Subproject Handling**:
  - Identify all subprojects with changes using `git status`.
  - **Exclude** `common` and `proto` subprojects:
    - Do **not** run `git pull`, `git commit`, or `git push` in these directories.
    - These are managed manually by the developer.
  - For all other subprojects with changes, apply the same Git workflow as the main project.

### 3. Commit Process
- Generate a commit message in the format: `<BranchName> Version <Release>.<Stage>.<Feature>.<Patch> - <Detailed description of changes>`.
- Present the commit message to the developer for review.
- **Wait** for developer confirmation before proceeding with the commit.
- Run `git add .` to stage all changes in the current project and applicable subprojects.
- Execute `git commit -m "<Commit Message>"` once approved.

### 4. Push Process
- After committing, run `git push origin <CurrentBranch>` to send changes to the remote repository.
- If the push fails (e.g., due to remote changes), repeat the "Check for Remote Changes" step and follow developer instructions.
  
### 5. Git Log Maintenance
- After a successful push to the remote branch, append an entry to `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/GitLog.md`.
- Each entry must follow this format:
    - **Sequential Number**: Increment based on the previous entry.
    - **Timestamp**: Record the current date and time.
    - **Short Commit Description**: A concise summary.
- Example entry:
        [<Sequential Number>] <BranchName> Version <Release>.<Stage>.<Feature>.<Patch> - <Timestamp> - <Short Commit Description>

### 6. Safety Rules
- **Never** modify, commit, or push changes in the `common` or `proto` subprojects.
- **Never** attempt to resolve merge conflicts without developer intervention.
- **Always** confirm versioning and commit messages with the developer before finalizing Git operations.
- If any errors occur during Git operations, log them and notify the developer immediately without proceeding.

## Example Commit Message
- For a branch named `feature/login` with a Stage version of `4`, Feature version of `2`, and Patch version incrementing to `3`:
    feature/login Version 0.4.2.3 - Implemented user authentication API and updated login UI


## Example GitLog Entry
- feature/login Version 0.4.2.3 - 2025-07-22 15:07:00 CEST - Implemented auth API and login UI


## Developer Interaction
- Before each commit, display:
  - Current branch name.
  - Proposed version number (e.g., `0.4.2.3`).
  - List of changed files and subprojects (excluding `common` and `proto`).
  - Proposed commit message.
- Wait for developer approval or modifications to the version or message.
- If remote changes are detected, prompt the developer with options to prioritize local/remote changes or resolve conflicts manually.
