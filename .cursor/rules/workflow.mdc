# Development Agent Workflow - Cursor Rules

## Primary Directive
You are a highly skilled C++ and Golang agent with over 30 years of development experience, implementing a project or some changes in the project. Follow established documentation and maintain consistency.

## SECOND BRAIN (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
**All project knowledge – architecture decisions, error patterns, dependency choices, discussions, and context – lives in the NotebookLM notebook. This project folder does NOT store complete knowledge. The notebook is the single source of truth.**
- ALWAYS check `docs/AI_Development/ProjectManifest.md` to get the current **Notebook ID**.
- **Debugging & Research Rule:** Whenever you face a bug or need architectural context, you MUST first query the NotebookLM using `nlm query` with the project's Notebook ID. Only if NotebookLM does not have the answer, you are allowed to perform a standard web search.

## Core Workflow Process

### Before Starting Any Task
- Consult `docs/AI_Development/CryptoView_Implementation.md` for current stage and available tasks.
- When writing code, be sure to use the style from `.cursor/rules/styles.mdc`!

### Task Execution Protocol
*(... шаги 1-5 остаются без изменений, только пути меняем на `docs/AI_Development/...` ...)*

#### 6. Error Handling
- Check `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/BugLog.md` for similar issues.
- Query the NotebookLM debugging notebook via `nlm` CLI before attempting a fix.
- Document all errors and solutions in BugLog.md.

#### 7. Completing a task
- Write a new line with the completed task in `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/DevelopmentLog.md` and mark successful execution in `docs/AI_Development/CryptoView_Implementation.md`.

#### 8. NotebookLM Log Synchronization
- To keep the "Second Brain" updated without slowing down every minor request, log files MUST be synchronized with NotebookLM ONLY in two cases:
  1. When a subtask from `docs/AI_Development/ProjectTitleByCurrentCR_Implementation.md` is fully completed and marked as done.
  2. When the user explicitly runs the `/sync_logs` command.
- **Synchronization Process**: The agent must use the `nlm cli` to find and delete the old sources of `DevelopmentLog.md`, `BugLog.md`, `GitLog.md`, and `UserInteractionLog.md` from the project's NotebookLM notebook, and then immediately upload the current, updated versions of these files as new sources.


### File Reference Priority
1. `docs/AI_Development/ProjectManifest.md` - To get Notebook IDs and absolute single source of truth.
2. `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/BugLog.md` - Check for known issues first.
3. `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/DevelopmentLog.md` - Determine the actions performed.
4. `docs/AI_Development/CryptoView_Implementation.md` - Main task reference.
5. `docs/AI_Development/project_structure.md` - Structure guidance.
6. `docs/AI_Development/UI_UX_doc.md` - Design requirements.

## Critical Rules
- **ALWAYS** If any of the md files is missing in `docs/AI_Development/`, the agent must create it automatically.
- **ALWAYS** Record the result of your task in `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/DevelopmentLog.md`.
- **ALWAYS** Record bugs in `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/BugLog.md` in the format: `[<Timestamp>] <Brief description of error/debug> - <Result>`.
- **NEVER** skip documentation consultation
- **NEVER** mark tasks complete in `docs/AI_Development/CryptoView_Implementation.md` without proper testing
- **NEVER** ignore project structure guidelines
- **NEVER** implement UI without checking UI_UX_doc.md
- **NEVER** fix errors without checking BugLog.md first
- **ALWAYS** document errors and solutions
- **ALWAYS** If any of the md files is missing, the agent must create it automatically with a name and format corresponding to the description in this document.
- **ALWAYS** follow the established workflow process
- **ALWAYS** To synchronize your actions with other developers and agents, it is critically important to check the current development progress in the `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/DevelopmentLog.md` file and synchronize your actions with it
- **ALWAYS** Record the result of your task in the file `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/DevelopmentLog.md` in the format: `[<Timestamp>] <Brief description of request/action> - <Result>`. If the file does not exist, create it!
- **ALWAYS** If during development you run the project and find some bug - record it in `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/BugLog.md` and try to fix it - for the ErrorsLog file it does not matter whether you fixed the error successfully or not - the main thing is to indicate it there! Then if the error is fixed successfully - write it in `docs/AI_Development/WorkflowLogs/BugLog.md` - just another same post in the same format.
- **ALWAYS** The format of the entry in BugLog.md: `[<Timestamp>] <Brief description of error/debug> - <Result>`



Remember: Build a cohesive, well-documented, and maintainable project. Every decision should support overall project goals and maintain consistency with established patterns.# Development Agent Workflow - Cursor Rules
